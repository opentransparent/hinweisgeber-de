Signatories are stored in _data/names.csv They are added to the document in the order they appear in that file. As such, if you want them to appear in alphabetical order you will need to add them to the file in alphabetical order. 

The files is CSV file that looks like the following:

```

The first line is a header line and should be left at the top. Anything below that line is data, whatever text is in the first column (name) will be added to the document.

To edit the document in GitHub go to [https://github.com/opentransparent/hinweisgeber-de/blob/main/_data/names.csv](https://github.com/opentransparent/hinweisgeber-de/blob/main/_data/names.csv). You will see an edit icon that looks like a pencil. Click it and the contents of the fill will become editable. Once you have finished making your changes scroll to the bottom and click Commit Changes. You can add additional information about the changes you have made, but it isn't required, you can leave it as the default provided.
